Keywords:

*Radiometry* is the study of light propagation and reflection. It is used in physics, engineering, architecture, photography, and computer graphics. Radiometry works with objective and directly measurable quantities.

*Photometry* is an alternative system for describing the perception of that energy by a human observer.
the energy measured at each pixel is transported by a single light ray from the last surface along the light path. That ray is called a primary ray.
